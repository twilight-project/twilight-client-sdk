# Twilight Client SDK

Client SDK for Twilight protocol operations with WebAssembly support.

## Overview

This SDK provides client-side functionality for interacting with the Twilight blockchain protocol, specifically optimized for WebAssembly deployment. It includes support for:

- **Trading Operations**: Zero-knowledge trading with privacy preservation
- **Lending Operations**: Decentralized lending protocol integration  
- **Transaction Management**: Complete transaction lifecycle management
- **WASM Compatibility**: Optimized for browser and WebAssembly environments

## Features

- üîê **Privacy-Preserving**: Zero-knowledge proofs for transaction privacy
- üåê **WASM Ready**: Optimized for WebAssembly deployment
- üí± **Trading Support**: Complete trading operations workflow
- üè¶ **Lending Integration**: DeFi lending protocol support
- üîß **Utility Functions**: Comprehensive helper functions

## Usage

```rust
use twilight_client_sdk::ContractManager;

// Initialize contract manager
let contract_manager = ContractManager::new();

// Use the SDK for blockchain operations
// ... (examples will be expanded)
```

## WASM Compatibility

This branch includes specific optimizations for WebAssembly deployment:

- Modified transaction handling for browser environments
- WASM-compatible data structures
- Optimized memory usage for web applications

## Dependencies

This SDK depends on several Twilight ecosystem crates:
- `zkos-rust` - Core blockchain primitives
- `zk-schnorr` - Zero-knowledge signature schemes
- `quisquis-rust` - Privacy-preserving cryptography
